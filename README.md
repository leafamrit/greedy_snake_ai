## Greedy Snake AI (1-step lookahead)
Based off https://leafamrit.github.io/snake_game, a greedy snake that looks one step ahead and moves to the apple while saving itself.

+ At every step, looks 1 step into the future to see if it is approaching the apple while not colliding with itself.
+ Will only die if all possible directions result in collision, which can happen very frequently once the snake gets long enough.
+ On loading, user is presented with a prompt to mention number of iterations are to be run (default value is 5)
+ After all iterations are complete, a file is downloaded with an array of all the scores received in every iteration.
+ Since the array is stored in browser memory before being downloaded, the maximum number of iterations is limited by the memory limitations of the browser.
